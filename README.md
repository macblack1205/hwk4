# Communications Platform Development Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Communications Platform Development project repository! This project is part of the Software Engineering course at Işık University. Our goal is to develop a hypothetical communications platform with various modules, including voice response systems, call center servers, and customer relationship management (CRM) applications.

## Gantt Chart

Our project timeline is visually represented in the Gantt chart. View the Gantt chart [here](#) (link to be updated).

## Project Duration

The project duration is outlined in the Gantt chart. Please note that some estimations might have inconsistencies, which have been considered in our planning.

## Activity Network/Chart

## Team Size and Roles

We've opted for single-person tasks, and our team consists of two multi-functional individuals: MuhammadJibril Khamiddinov and Abdel Rahman Khaled Mustafa Elmughrabi.

## Contingency Plan

In case of unforeseen setbacks, our contingency plan includes regular progress assessments, efficient communication, and a dynamic adaptation strategy to minimize negative impacts on the project timeline.

## Setback Scenario

To address a hypothetical setback scenario, where task T1.6 takes longer than expected (e.g., 40 weeks instead of 10), we will implement the following:

- **Effect on the Overall Project:**
  - A delay in task T1.6 could potentially impact subsequent tasks and extend the overall project duration.

- **Contingency Plan:**
  - Regularly assess progress and identify potential delays.
  - Allocate additional resources if necessary.
  - Reallocate tasks to optimize efficiency.
